<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I had to manage my profiles using the gui tool, had to connect disconnect, and change profiles while listening to song and when i had to call, all of this needed
a separate tool to implement and several commands which needed human interaction, that's exactly where this script will come in handy it reduced human interaction 
to the point of execution of command and put all of those things 'I USED' into one place, you want something else? Fork it or send a pull request so that i can
add this into the original script.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

I will be illustrating you on how to setup the tool and what features it has in the next few sections.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/proffapt/whapc.git
   ```
2. Make the scripts executable
   ```sh
   cd whapc 
   chmod +x ./whapc ./setup.sh
   ```
3. Executing the setup script
   ```sh
   ./setup.sh
   ```
   Aliter:
   Install following dependencies according to your package manager, if the install script fails.
   `bluez`, `libpulse` and `pulseaudio`.
   Along with installing the above mentioned dependencies, it adds the script path into the PATH env variable (obviously after asking you.. duhh).
   Currently supported shell types are `bash`, `fish` and `zsh`.
   
4. Run the tool for first time using, and learn the usage on the go

   ```sh
   ./whapc -h
   ```
   And follow as the screen instructs, i.e. add the name for bluetooth device and mac-address for it (This will be a one time task)
